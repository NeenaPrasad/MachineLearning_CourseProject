Excercise Quality Prediction

Human Activity Recognition

Human Activity Recognition - HAR - has emerged as a key research area in the last years and is gaining 
increasing attention by the pervasive computing research community (see picture below, that illustrates 
the increasing number of publications in HAR with wearable accelerometers), especially for the development 
of context-aware systems. There are many potential applications for HAR, like: elderly monitoring, life 
log systems for monitoring energy expenditure and for supporting weight-loss programs, and digital assistants
for weight lifting exercises.

This project involves studying the exercise data, ie, data from the sensors placed at arm, forearm, dumbbell 
and belt to evaluate how well a person does exercise. The idea is to predict the quality of exercise.
