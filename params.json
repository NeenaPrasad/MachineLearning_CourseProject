There are many potential applications for HAR, like: elderly monitoring, life \r\nlog systems for monitoring energy expenditure and for supporting weight-loss programs, and digital assistants\r\nfor weight lifting exercises.\r\n\r\nRead more: http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har#ixzz40A4ZbGUZ\r\n\r\nThis project involves studying the exercise data, ie, data from the sensors placed at arm, forearm, dumbbell \r\nand belt to evaluate how well a person does exercise. The idea is to predict the quality of exercise.\r\n\r\nTraining dataset can be found in : https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv\r\nTesting/ predicting dataset can be found in: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
